# -------------------------------------------
# Exercise 1: Input, Output, and Git
# -------------------------------------------
# In this exercise you will:
# 1. Write a short Python program using variables, input(), and print().
# 2. Save your work with Git commands.

# ---------------------------
# Step 1: Python Task
# ---------------------------
# TODO: Write a program that:
# - Asks the user for their name
# - Asks the user for their age
# - Prints a message like:
#   "Hello Alice, next year you will be 26!"

# HINTS:
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# age = int(input("How old are you? "))
# print(f"Hello {name}, next year you will be {age + 1}!")
name = input("What is your name?")
print(f"Hello, " + name +"!")
age = int(input("How old are you?"))
favouriteColour = input("What is your favourite colour?")
favouriteFood = input("What is your favourite food?")
print(f"Hello {name}, next year you will be {age + 1}. Your favourite colour is {favouriteColour} and you are really like {favouriteFood}!")
# ---------------------------
# Step 2: Git Task
# ---------------------------
# Once your Python program runs correctly, do the following in the terminal:
#
# 1. Check the status of your repo:
#    git status
#
# 2. Add this specific file to staging:
#    git add Ex1_input_output.py
#
# 3. Commit your change with a message:
#    git commit -m "Completed input/output exercise"
#
# 4. (Optional) Add all files in one go:
#    git add .
#    git commit -m "Updated repo with latest changes"
#
# 5. Push your work to GitHub:
#    git push origin main
#
# ---------------------------
# ⭐ Extension Challenge (optional):
# ---------------------------
# - Ask the user for their favourite colour AND favourite food.
# - Print a personalised message combining all the information.
#   Example:
#   "Hello Alice, next year you will be 26. Your favourite colour is blue
#   and you really like pizza!"
#
# - Make sure you use variables for all inputs and format the output clearly.
#
# Once complete, save your work with another commit:
# git add Ex1_input_output.py
# git commit -m "Completed extension challenge"
# git push origin main
#
# ---------------------------
# ✅ Done!
